# Section 1: 
## What is React.js?
React is a **Javascript library** for building **user interfaces**. React uses Javascript in the browser to update the page and the user interface without reloading the page. 
Javascript in the end runs in the background of a website and Javascript is ale to read and manipulate the webpage after is was loaded, so javascript can as I click on a tab, it fetched the data behind the scenes without reloading or leaving the page, and it then updates what I see on the screen with that data leeding to that smooth transition between those pages. 
React.js helps to avoid javascript error-prone and build complex web app in a simple way.
Working with React is **Declarative** that means that we define the goal, not the steps; while in Javascript is **Imperative** because we define the steps to get to a certain target.

## Why we can't use React as Javascript, just with html, css and a script?
Its because React uses JSX ( JavaScritp XML a mix of html and javascript ), and JSX doesn't work in the browser. JSX needs to be transform to code that does run in the browser. That is why when creating React apps we need to use extra tools like Vite.
